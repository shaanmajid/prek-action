# Prek Action

A GitHub Action that runs [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks using [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) in your CI/CD pipeline.

*Despite the name, `pre-commit` hooks can be run at any time, not just before commits.*

## What is prek?

[prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) is a fast hooks runner that provides an alternative to the widely-used [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) framework. It offers better performance and caching capabilities for running code quality checks.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Prek checks
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  prek:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: j178/prek-action@v1
```

> [!NOTE]
> This action assumes that a Python version is installed on the runner. If you’re using a self-hosted/custom runner,
> ensure Python is installed before calling this action (e.g. via [`actions/setup-python`](https://github.com/actions/setup-python)).

### Custom Arguments

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v6
  - uses: j178/prek-action@v1
    with:
      extra-args: '--all-files --directory packages/'
```

### Running Specific Hooks

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v6
  - uses: j178/prek-action@v1
    with:
      extra-args: '--all-files mypy flake8 ruff'
```

### Specifying Prek Version

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v6
  - uses: j178/prek-action@v1
    with:
      prek-version: '0.2.1'
      extra-args: '--all-files'
```

### Install Only

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v6
  - uses: j178/prek-action@v1
    with:
      install-only: true
  - run: |
      prek run \
        --show-diff-on-failure \
        --color always
```

When `install-only` is set to `true`, the action will only install prek and skip running it. The `extra-args` input has no effect in this mode.

Running `prek` in a separate step can be useful for example when you need to customize the environment.

## Inputs

| Input              | Description                                | Required | Default       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| `extra-args`       | Additional arguments to pass to `prek run` | No       | `--all-files` |
| `install-only`     | Only install prek, do not run it           | No       | `false`       |
| `prek-version`     | Version of prek to install (e.g., '0.2.1', 'latest') | No | `latest` |
| `working-directory` | The working directory to run prek in      | No       | `.`           |
| `token`            | GitHub token to avoid API rate limiting   | No       | `${{ github.token }}` |

## Outputs

| Output         | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `prek-version` | The resolved version of prek that was installed       |

## Versioning

This action follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). You can pin to different levels of specificity:

```yaml
# Recommended: pin to specific version (immutable)
- uses: j178/prek-action@v1.1.0

# Pin to major version (receives backwards-compatible updates)
- uses: j178/prek-action@v1

# Pin to exact commit SHA (most secure)
- uses: j178/prek-action@564dda4cfa5e96aafdc4a5696c4bf7b46baae5ac
```

For security-sensitive environments, pinning to a specific version or commit SHA is recommended.

## Requirements

Your repository must have a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file configured for use with pre-commit hooks.
